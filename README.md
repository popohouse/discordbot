## Requirements
- Python 3.10 and up - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- git - https://git-scm.com/download/
- Discord bot with Message Intent enabled

## Useful to always have
Keep [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) saved somewhere, as this is the docs to discord.py@rewrite.
All you need to know about the library is defined inside here, even code that I don't use in this example is here.

## How to setup
1. Make a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and grab the token
![Image_Example1](https://i.alexflipnote.dev/f9668b.png)

2. Rename the file **config.json.example** to **config.json** moving it to to data folder, then fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and game,

3. To install what you need, do **pip install -r requirements.txt**<br>
(If that doesn't work, do **python -m pip install -r requirements.txt**)<br>
`NOTE: Use pip install with Administrator/sudo`

4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type **python index.py**

5. You're done, enjoy your bot!

# Optional tools

### Docker
Docker is an alternative to run the bot 24/7 and always reboot again whenever it crashed. You can find the install manual [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). You don't *have* to get it, but if you're used to having Docker, it's available at least.
```
# Build and run the Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d --build

# Tips on common commands
docker-compose <command>
  ps      Check if bot is online or not (list)
  down    Shut down the bot
  reboot  Reboot the bot without shutting it down or rebuilding
  logs    Check the logs made by the bot.
```
